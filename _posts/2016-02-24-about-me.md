I'm mostly unremarkable. Just like Arthur Dent, really. Although that's probably not the best analogy since he ended up being pretty significant. Maybe I will --- one day --- be totally remarkable.

In life, I feel as though I largely failed. I put about 20% effort at school, but still somehow scraped through my exams. I do truly believe I'm largely clever, but after years of not really exercising my brain it's become lazy and useless. I need to exercise it more; I need to exercise every part of my body more.

Past jobs have included "bottle watching" at Guinness, website design, software development, driving a forklift truck, carer (for my disabled wife) and most recently, a failed photographer. I mostly enjoyed those jobs but I definitely had my "fuck this shit" days. Who doesn't?

Still, I'm only 30... there is time to turn things around yet. My goal in life is to not have to say "no" to my children when they want something just because I can't afford it. They deserve to hear "yes" a bit more often. Thankfully, they're not little shits unlike some children you see.

I'm currently, legally, married although we have lived apart for just over a year now. Only one way that relationship is going1\. I was a tit, but I'm not liable for 100% of the blame. It takes two to tango, right?

I have two lovely children. Lilly-Mae and Ivy. If I were to ever have another, it will probably be named after a plant too. I don't want more though; children ruin relationships. I wouldn't wish them away though.

Some of my favourite things to do are play games (great stress relief), swear (great stress relief), drive fast (great stress relief), laugh (great stress relief), cook (great stress relief). Quite recently I've started ice skating which, surprisingly, offers great stress relief.

I need a lot of stress relief because a lot of things piss me off, such as: people who don't use their indicators, people who think driving 15mph below the speed limit on a dry day is appropriate, people who get to the till in a shop, have their stuff scanned and then go back into store to get more stuff while the rest of us are stood there like dickheads, people who jump queues (I'm British, what do you expect?), people who walk 3 abreast and block the whole fucking pavement, people who walk on the right side of the pavement (drive left, walk left), people who get offended at every. single. thing breathe Vegans, femi-nazis, people who label their children with a disorder because they won't admit they've done a shit job and raising them and need to give some cold hard discipline, people who say "just..." without ever having had to "just...", self pompous pricks who think they're better than everybody because they studied art at university and only drink/eat items that are "fair trade". I got news for you, I love Nestl√© and I don't really care if children are paid tuppence to pick cocoa beans. That shit tastes Good. I also don't care about a few dead monkeys so I can enjoy some Nutella. Get over it. I hate people who try to stop people having fun because, for gods sake, you might harm a cow that was going to the abattoir anyway. 
The list goes on.
My favourite food ever is bacon. It makes nasty things nice, and nice things nicer. I don't care that it can cause cancer --- after years of harassing my parents to get them to quit smoking just because of it's negative health affects, I now get it.
My uncle has cancer. Leukaemia to be more precise. That fact kind of makes me previous statement seem insensitive, but he loves bacon too. He'll be the first person to die that I will be truly upset about. I've lost all but one of my grandparents, but old people are supposed to die, young(er) people aren't. If he dies, I honestly don't know how I will deal with it. But hey, positive thoughts, right?
About that one remaining grandparent...
In the year since my grandad --- her husband --- pegged it, I've spent more time with her. I feel guilty for not getting to know my other grandparents when I had the chance (stop saying "I'll see them next week" one week, you won't be able to and it's shit realising you passed up the chance to see them). Spending time with her has revealed a lot, but one thing I never knew is that she is a qualified music teacher! I've known for years she could play piano, but that revelation stunned me. Go nan!
That's the long, rambling version of me. I don't have enough stories to fill an autobiography, but if just one sentence of this incoherent diatribe against myself and other gives you just a moment of humour, then it will have been a success.
