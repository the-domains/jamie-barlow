After a good bit of use and falling in love with it, I am selling my Nikon D750\. I don't want to, but I have to. My ultimate long term goal is to either a) buy another one or b) pick up a Sony A7II. I think the Sony will be better for my needs. It's smaller and lighter, ideal for running around the park or casual walks out --- which is all the D750 was used for. If I were ever to "go pro" in the future, I would definitely jump back to a fully DSLR, but then I would have to consider Canon, especially if I went into weddings/portraits.
