'The New Apple TV' --- it's unofficial, official name since Apple doesn't actually assign it a number unlike the iPhone, iPad and iPod line1 --- has been around now for about 3 months. There are plenty of reviews on the web. From Cult of Mac to RedmondPie, opinions are plentiful. I didn't read a single review before buying mine. I didn't really need to, because I knew all I needed to know: there is a Plex app and there is a VLC app.

I wish I had read some reviews though, because honestly it feels like a half-baked product. Since getting it I've read them just to see if people share some of my opinions about it. Mostly, my points --- good and bad --- are echoed in each article that you come across.

\#\#THE UI

The UI, like everything from Apple, is very pretty. The animations happen at a nice relaxed pace, but not so slow you get annoyed. The animations and the UI can be jerky and laggy some times though, and it happens often enough to be annoying. Browsing film posters in Plex seems to be the biggest offender, but it also happens in the App Store, iTunes films, VLC etc. It's important to note though that this could be due to input lag from the remote, rather than the AppleTV not having enough power to render large lists.

The UI is lighter than previous gen Apple TVs, and so jumping out of a film and back to the menu can be hard on your eyes, especially if it's a dark scene that you're exiting from. I'd like to see a "dark mode" --- but then I would love to see that in iOS and OS X too.

Generally, the UI gets a thumbs up.

THE REMOTE 

Honestly, the only things I like about the remote are: 

\*It's not IR, and so you don't need line of sight to use it. 

\*I can control the volume on my TV.
The new "Siri" remote.
The New Apple TV's remote with silly button layout. 

The button layout makes no sense. They're clumped in the middle of the remote where, if you pick it up the remote the wrong way round --- something that is far too easy to do --- you can't immediately tell which button is which. The only real tactile feedback you get is from the Siri button which is slightly concave. The top half of the remote is actually a trackpad, but it feels so similar to the function-less bottom half that, again, you can't tell if you have it in the correct orientation which leads you to ask "why isn't it working?" before you realise you're holding it wrong.

The design team have absolutely gone for form over function here and whilst it is nice piece of hardware, I think it needs to be a bit more practical. Thumbs down for the remote.

THE APPLE TV 

The AppleTV itself hasn't really changed. It's a bit taller, has a USB-C port instead of micro-USB and gone is the optical audio connection --- something I never used anyway. It has a beefier CPU --- an A8, the same gen chip that is in the iPhone 6 --- and a nice 2Gb of RAM. Whilst it's a nice hardware package, the A8 will be two years old this year, and so I can't see me having this unit more than 18-months before it's starts suffering in performance. 

32GB VS 64GB

I've not come across a compelling reason as to why the 64Gb model actually exists. As far as I can tell, most things (even apps) are sort of streamed on demand, with no app being able to claim more than a few hundred megabytes of space on a permanent basis. I think the exception to this is films, which will download as you watch, but then delete themselves afterwards. Certainly for now, I think 32Gb is the model to go for. As the ecosystem (and tvOS) expands, there may be a reason to go for a higher capacity model with the next gen version, but for now, save the Â£40 and buy some films to watch instead ðŸ˜‰

Overall, I like this product. tvOS makes it worth the upgrade for me. Being able to run Plex and not hear fan noise like I do with my PS4 was reason enough to upgrade, but for those who just want to watch iTunes movies, YouTube and do a bit of AirPlay may be better with the 3rd Gen box which is just Â£59\. 

SIRI

Siri is the biggest disappointment for me so far. It's clear Apple intends great things for it's virtual assistant. The demo when they announced the product was so chock full of Siri that it was tempting to believe they might call this something other than Apple TV. Heck, even the remote has a dedicated Siri button which they clearly want you to use because it has that concave surface to set it a part from the other buttons.

But then you ask it to play a podcast; can't help. Do any one of a variety of HomeKit tasks; can't help. Play something from Plex? You guessed it... can't help. 

Now, I'm sure that Siri will do all that was demoed in the keynote last September, but for my use cases, it's not really good enough. What makes it worse is that my phone will happily play a podcast or control my Philips Hue lights without skipping a beat.

If I'm looking for a positive though, I must say that voice recognition accuracy is much better than on the iPhone, even when there is audio in the background. How ever they've done it --- I assume it's quite a specialist microphone in the remote --- I would love to see that sort of accuracy in the iPhone 7\.

If you're keeping count, this is actually the 4th generation Apple TV and the Apple website has now been updated to reflect this.
