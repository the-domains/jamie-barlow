![The Philips Hue Starter Set](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/71a7168e-4ce9-4118-a98b-462368268451.jpg)

I've wanted some smart bulbs for a long time. Something about the "you don't have to get of your ass to turn the lights off" scenario really appeals to my lazy side AND my inner geek.
![I’m the fanboy on the right — if you were to add a few extra pounds.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/690ec554-0e69-4420-be76-ce9960ed6ee1.jpg)

I recently decided to invest in some now that they are a bit more affordable/useful and, as a self-confessed Apple fan-obi, I knew I wanted some lights that would be compatible with HomeKit. It didn't take long to find out that the Philips Hue bulbs that I'd heard about it the past could take full advantage of HomeKit thanks to their fancy new Philips Bridge 2.0\. This little bridge sits on your network via cable\[note\]No WiFi option, but I guess Philips are more concerned with rock solid connectivity than with convenience here. Without a functioning bridge, you might as well have regular lightbulbs.\[/note\] and uses the ZigBee wireless standard to communicate with your bulbs. It's the brains of the operation.

After a quick bit of research, I bought a \[Philips Hue Starter Set\](http://amzn.to/1lDlO35) with next day delivery from Amazon\[note\]Philips advertise the starter set in two variants: one comes with B22 (Bayonet) bulbs, and the other with E27 (screw) bulbs. Unfortunately the B22 set is hard to find, so I bought the E27 set and some B22-E27 converters.\[/note\] because I am not a patient person. 

Once it arrived, setup was a breeze and within 10 minutes all three lights from the starter pack were functioning. 10 Minutes later I was on my way to my nearest Apple store to get some more bulbs --- three just doesn't cut it! 

\#\# The cost of being a geek 

The starter set comes with the aforementioned bridge and three colour bulbs, and will set you back \[£149.99 on Amazon\](http://amzn.to/1lDlO35)\[note\]It's pretty much the same price everywhere. I found it for £140 at one online retailer, but they were out of stock.\[/note\]. The colour bulbs in the set can be set to just about any colour you can imagine (there are 16.9 million available colours), but if you want more than those, they cost a cool \[£49.99 each on Amazon\](http://amzn.to/1WC4uZB). Not cheap, especially compared to a regular bulb. The upfront cost for me to replace \*just the main light\* in each room of my small 2-bedroom bungalow would be £200, plus the cost of the starter kit on top of that --- £349.99\. 

Fortunately, Philips also offer a \[standard white bulb\](http://amzn.to/1WCfLcq) for just £14.99\. Still pricey, but more palatable than the full colour bulbs. The downside though is that the white bulbs can't change colour, and their only real feature is that they can be dimmed. Still useful, and with some planning, you can save money. Where are you not likely to want funky lighting? I know I don't want my kitchen or hallway bathed in a million different hues, and so the white lights are ideal for those locations (at least for now). My living room and bedrooms though, I definitely want them to have awesome lighting.

From the main lights, to table and floor lamps and accent lighting, replacing all bulbs at £49.99... Well, being a geek is expensive. I can see it costing near to £1000 just for lighting (not including the available strip lighting), and I know I will want a smart thermostat, coffee machine and alarm system further down the line providing they are HomeKit compatible.

One saving grace is that the bulbs have a 15-20 year life and cost very little to run thanks to being LED, so by the time I'm 50 I should have recouped the cost. 

\#\# Siri & homekit

It brings out my inner child, being able to control my lights using my voice. It's seriously fucking awesome. I \*know\* the novelty will wear off eventually, but right now, I am living in the future, man.

HomeKit is something Apple should be proud of. \*It just works\*. HomeKit isn't an app. It's a framework and a database of 'homes', 'rooms', 'devices' and 'zones'. Any manufacture can make an app that utilises the HomeKit framework\[note\]Or indeed, person. Home by Matthias Hochgatterer is just such an app made by a third party.\[/note\]. Because all this is just being written into the HomeKit UI, a lot of it is ready to be used in other apps. For example, I setup my rooms and lights --- a.k.a. accessories --- in the official Philips Hue app, and thanks to HomeKit, when I launched \[Home\](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/home-smart-home-automation/id995994352?mt=8&at=1010l4VN), everything was already there and waiting for me to carry on playing. 

\#\# Conclusion 

I really like these smart bulbs. I want to add some dimmer switches to the collection so I'm not so reliant on my phone, but right now, that is really the only complaint I have.
