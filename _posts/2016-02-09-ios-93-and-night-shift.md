I'm sat here listening to [ATP][0] where Marco, John and Casey are [discussing the recent addition of _Night Shift_][1] in the recently released BETA of [iOS 9.3][2]. They talk about when [f.lux][3] released a binary and instructions to allow you to install the app on your device back in November. Shortly after, they pulled all the information from their website at the request of Apple, and whether this was done because Apple was already working on a similar feature for iOS \[Night Shift\] or because they wanted to 'steal' the idea.

Now, I don't think 'steal' is the correct word here. Historically, Apple has lifted ideas from the jailbreak community --- where f.lux made it's rise to fame --- and implemented them natively into iOS. From notification centre, control centre and quick reply and now f.lux. Heck, even folders for iOS apps was originally a jailbreak tweak; I think with the community innovating, iOS would have stagnated a long time ago.

I think it's fair to assume that Apple has thought about a f.lux like feature for a while. Taking their time, as Apple do, and researching the benefits of it before hastily making a native feature.

As for their reasons to have the original f.lux team stop distribution? Well, the official statement is that they were violating their Apple Developer agreement. But, side-loading apps is perfectly "legal". In fact, there are other big name apps that can't be released on the App Store for various reasons, that allow side-loading and their developers haven't been asked to stop distribution. So why f.lux? It can't have been because Apple wanted to do it first. Once iOS 9.3 is released people will simply stop caring that f.lux exists\[note\]At least for iOS; they also do an OS X version\[/note\] because it's such a pain to install.

The only reasonable reason I can think of for Apple's request was to legally distance themself and stop the claims of "you stole that" before f.lux gained even more popularity (the app and had been downloaded and installed millions of times).

If I'm being perfectly honest, I don't even fully believe that. f.lux also have an OS X version of their app --- or should I call it a utility? --- and they are still maintaining and releasing it.

Apple will probably release _Night Shift_ for OS X soon enough given that the feature gap between desktop and mobile is shrinking all the time. Apple couldn't demand that the desktop counterpart stop being maintained and released as all that takes place outside of the Apple Developer Program, and as such they have no authority to do so.

An aqui-hire would have made sense; buy the company, shut it down and assign the staff to other projects (or pay them off), but if that was the case, it would have happened already.

So no, I can't think of one_good_ reason that Apple would make such an unessecary move against a single company.

Over the years, my list of reasons for _needing_ to jailbreak has shortened. f.lux was one of the reasons I still do when it's possible. Now though, there are only three good reasons for me to JailBreak:

1. Customisation over Control Centre.
2. The ability to add, hide, remove and reorder icons in my status bar.
3. Conditionally turning mobile data on or off depending on WiFi state to save battery.

And I can only imagine that, on a not-so-infinite timescale, Apple would implement all of those features to some degree.

Of course, there are other JailBreak tweaks that enhance parts of iOS, but in terms of big, innovative features, there is barely anything new anymore.
